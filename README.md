### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of a Computer Science  who is excited about IT world. Especially programming is my favourite field. I usually work with C/C++ or Python however I never miss an opportunity to learn something completly new. The best thing about programming is, that it is not only about writing a code. It is also about meeting new people who are on the same page, discovering new technologies and challenging myself. And I really enjoy it!

- And I am enjoying helping people to improve their IT skills, especially by teaching kids in Programming club
