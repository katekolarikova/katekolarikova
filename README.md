### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am excited student of a Computer Science who fell in love with programming. It is because programming is not only about writing a code. It is also about meeting new peopel who are on the same page or about discovering new technologies. And I really enjoy it!

- I am studying at VSB - Technical University of Ostrava and my field is Computer Science
- I usually work with C/C++ or Python
